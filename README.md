# About memorama-project
Repository for a short Unity project. It's a memory game, where you have to find the pair of each of the cards present in a deck.

# General concept
There is a panel with a certain number of cards, each of which has its own pair. The user has to guess and match each pair to discard them from the deck. If the player runs out of cards, he wins.

# Unique value proposition
This game tests you how efficient and fast your memory is for the association of similar images between the deck of cards that change their appearance at your disposal.

# Player experience
The feelings that the player has to convey are between tranquility, because the game will not have many tense elements, and also happiness and satisfaction at being able to complete a deck of cards.
